        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">  Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
            <br>

            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
            <br>

            For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> In directing the activities of the young, society determines its own future in determining that of the young. Since the young at a given time will at some later date compose the society of that period, the latter's nature will largely turn upon the direction children's activities were given at an earlier period. This cumulative movement of action toward a later result is what is meant by growth.
            <br>

            The primary condition of growth is immaturity. This may seem to be a mere truism - saying that a being can develop only in some point in which he is undeveloped. But the prefix "im" of the word immaturity means something positive, not a mere void or lack. and by potentiality potency, force. Now when we say that immaturity means the possibility of growth, we are not referring to absence of powers which may exist at a later time; we express a force positively present - the ability to develop.
